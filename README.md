# Multimodal-Machine-Learning-for-Credit-Modeling

Credit ratings are traditionally generated using
models that use financial statement data and market data, which
is tabular (numeric and categorical). Practitioner and academic
models do not include text data. Using an automated approach
to combine long-form text from SEC filings with the tabular
data, we show how multimodal machine learning using stack
ensembling and bagging can generate more accurate rating
predictions. This paper demonstrates a methodology to use big
data to extend tabular data models, which have been used by the
ratings industry for decades, to the class of multimodal machine
learning models.
